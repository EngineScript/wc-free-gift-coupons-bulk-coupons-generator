Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

# Work Environment

This project is coded entirely in a remote development environment using GitHub Codespaces. The AI will never ask me to run Terminal commands or use a local development environment. All code changes, tests, and debugging will be done within remote repositories on GitHub. 

Change summaries should be concise and clear, focusing on the specific changes made. The AI should not ask for confirmation before making changes, as all code modifications will be done directly in the remote environment. 

# Responses

When delivering responses, the AI should provide clear, concise, and actionable information. Responses should be formatted in a way that is easy to read and understand, with a focus on clarity and precision. The AI should avoid unnecessary verbosity or complexity in its explanations.

Responses, change summaries, and code comments should be written in English. The AI should not use any other languages or dialects, including regional variations of English. All communication should be clear and professional, adhering to standard English grammar and spelling conventions. 

Responses should be delivered only in the chat interface. Formatting and styling should be utilized to enhance readability.

Change summaries should never be created in the form of new .md files.

# Code Analysis and Reading Standards

You must read files completely and thoroughly, with a minimum of 1000 lines per read operation when analyzing code. Never truncate files or stop reading at arbitrary limits like 50 or 100 lines - this lazy approach provides incomplete context and leads to poor suggestions. When you encounter any file, read it from the very first line to the absolute last line, processing all functions, classes, variables, imports, exports, and code structures. Your analysis must be based on the complete file content, not partial snapshots. Always read at least 1000 lines minimum per read operation, and if the file is larger, continue reading until you've processed the entire file. Do not use phrases like "showing first X lines" or "truncated for brevity" or "rest of file omitted" - these indicate lazy, incomplete analysis. Instead, demonstrate that you've read the complete file by referencing specific sections throughout the entire codebase, understanding the full context of how functions interact, how variables are used across the entire file, and how the complete code structure works together. Your suggestions and recommendations must reflect knowledge of the entire file, not just the beginning portions. Take the time to read everything properly because thoroughness and accuracy based on complete file knowledge is infinitely more valuable than quick, incomplete reviews that miss critical context and lead to incorrect suggestions.

# Coding Standards and Preferences

## WordPress Focused Design

- This project is focused on WordPress development.
- Use WordPress coding standards and best practices.
- Leverage WordPress APIs and functions where applicable.
- Ensure compatibility with modern WordPress versions and PHP standards. WordPress 6.5+ and PHP 7.4+ are the baseline.
- Use WordPress hooks (actions and filters) to extend functionality.
- Follow WordPress theme and plugin development guidelines.
- Use WordPress REST API for custom endpoints and data retrieval.
- Ensure all code is compatible with the WordPress ecosystem, including themes and plugins.
- As this is a WordPress-focused project, avoid using frameworks or libraries that are not compatible with WordPress.
- Do not use frameworks or libraries that are not commonly used in the WordPress ecosystem.
- Avoid using non-standard or experimental features that are not widely adopted in the WordPress community.
- For any project that utilizes WooCommerce, ensure minimum version compatibility with WooCommerce 5.0+.

# General Coding Standards

- The above standards are prioritized over general coding standards.
- The standards below are general coding standards that apply to all code, including WordPress code. Do not apply them if they conflict with WordPress standards.

**Accessibility & UX**
- Follow accessibility best practices for UI components
- Ensure forms are keyboard-navigable and screen reader friendly
- Validate user-facing labels, tooltips, and messages for clarity

**Performance & Optimization**
- Optimize for performance and scalability where applicable
- Avoid premature optimization—focus on correctness first
- Detect and flag performance issues (e.g., unnecessary re-renders, N+1 queries)
- Use lazy loading, memoization, or caching where needed

**Type Safety & Standards**
- Use strict typing wherever possible (TypeScript, C#, etc.)
- Avoid using `any` or untyped variables
- Use inferred and narrow types when possible
- Define shared types centrally (e.g., `types/` or `shared/` folders)

**Security & Error Handling**
- Sanitize all input and output, especially in forms, APIs, and database interactions
- Escape, validate, and normalize all user-supplied data
- Automatically handle edge cases and error conditions
- Fail securely and log actionable errors
- Avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages or logs

**Code Quality & Architecture**
- Organize code using **feature-sliced architecture** when applicable
- Group code by **feature**, not by type (e.g., keep controller, actions, and helpers together by feature)
- Write clean, readable, and self-explanatory code
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for files, functions, and variables
- Remove unused imports, variables, and dead code automatically

**Task Execution & Automation**
- Always proceed to the next task automatically unless confirmation is required
- Only ask for confirmation when an action is destructive (e.g., data loss, deletion)
- Always attempt to identify and fix bugs automatically
- Only ask for manual intervention if domain-specific knowledge is required
- Auto-generate missing files, boilerplate, and tests when possible
- Auto-lint and format code using standard tools (e.g., Prettier, ESLint, dotnet format)
- Changes should be made directly to the file in question. Example: admin.php should be modified directly, not by creating a new file like admin-changes.php.
- New files may be created when appropriate, but they should be relevant to the task at hand, so long as they are not a rewrite of an existing file. We want to avoid unnecessary duplication of files.
